OSS Overview and History

Copyright (c) 2024 semin12350

OSS refers to software whose source code is publicly available so that 
anyone can freely use, modify, and distribute it. OSS is usually managed by an 
open-source license,which clearly defines the right to use and share the software.

The history of open-source software (OSS) begins in the 1950s and 1970s, 
during the early computer age, when it was common for software to come with hardware 
and for source code to be released. During this time, academia and businesses formed 
a culture of cooperation by freely sharing software, but the spread of commercial software
in the 1980s led to the closure of source code. In response, in 1983, Richard Stallman
launched the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement, introducing the General Public License (GPL),
which guarantees the free use and distribution of software.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds announced the Linux kernel, which led to the full popularization of OSS.
In 1998, the Open Source OSI was established with the term "Open Source" to establish the definition 
and standard of OSS. Since then, major OSS projects such as Apache, MySQL, and PHP have 
led the development of web technology, large IT companies have participated in the OSS ecosystem, 
and OSS has become a key technology in new technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and AI.
